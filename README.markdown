# What's Up?

What's up watches web sites for you and lets you know when they are
unavailable.

# Usage

IM `help` to [whatsup@jabber.org](xmpp://whatsup@jabber.org) to see what you
can do.

# When Checks Are Performed

Any monitors you set up will run about once every fifteen minutes, but only
while you're active on XMPP.

You are considered inactive if any of the following are true:

* You are not logged in to your XMPP server.
* You are logged in, but your status is do not disturb.
* You have specifically told whatsup not to bother you (via the `off` command)
