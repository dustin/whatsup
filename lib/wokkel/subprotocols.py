class IQHandlerMixin(object):
    """
    XMPP subprotocol mixin for handle incoming IQ stanzas.

    This matches up the iq with XPath queries to call methods on itself,
    wrapping the call so that exceptions result in proper error responses,
    or, when succesful will reply with a response with optional payload.

    Derivatives of this class must provide an
    L{XmlStream<twisted.words.protocols.jabber.xmlstream.XmlStream>} instance
    in its C{xmlstream} attribute.

    The optional payload is taken from the result of the handler and is
    expected to be a child or a list of childs.

    If an exception is raised, or the deferred has its errback called,
    the exception is checked for being a L{error.StanzaError}. If so,
    an error response is sent. Any other exception will cause a error
    response of C{internal-server-error} to be sent.

    A typical way to use this mixin, is to set up L{xpath} observers on the
    C{xmlstream} to call handleRequest, for example in an overridden
    L{XMPPHandler.connectionMade}. It is likely a good idea to only listen for
    incoming iq get and/org iq set requests, and not for any iq, to prevent
    hijacking incoming responses to outgoing iq requests. An example:

        >>> QUERY_ROSTER = "/query[@xmlns='jabber:iq:roster']"
        >>> class MyHandler(XMPPHandler, IQHandlerMixin):
        ...    iqHandlers = {"/iq[@type='get']" + QUERY_ROSTER: 'onRosterGet',
